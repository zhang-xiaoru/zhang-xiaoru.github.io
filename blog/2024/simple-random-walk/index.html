If we denote the move of the particle at step $n$ as $X_n$, then $X_n$ is a Bernoulli variables and the sequence $X_1, X_2, \cdots$ is assume to be independent. The position of the particle after $n$ moves, denoted by $S_n$ is \(S_n = S_0+\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\notag\) the walk is called <em>symmetric</em> if $p=1/2$.</p> <h1 id="conditioned-properties">Conditioned properties</h1> <p>One of the main technique used in random walk is to conditioned on the first step f the walk and then solve the ensuring difference equation. Some important properties of conditional probabilist of random walk is as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Spatial homogeneity$$\mathbb{P}(S_n=j</td> <td>S_0=a)=\mathbb{P}(S_n=j+b</td> <td>S_0=a+b)$$</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Temporal homogeneity$$\mathbb{P}(S_{n+m}=j</td> <td>S_m=a)=\mathbb{P}(S_n=j</td> <td>S_0=a)$$</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Markov property (memory less)$$\mathbb{P}(S_{m+n}=j</td> <td>S_0, S_1,\cdots, S_m)=\mathbb{P}(S_{m+n}=j</td> <td>S_m), \quad n\geq 0$$. This means that conditional upon knowing the value of the process at $m$ step, the value after $m$ step do not depend on values before $m$ step.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> </ul> <h1 id="counting-paths-of-random-walk">Counting paths of random walk</h1> <p>Another useful technique is counting methods. Suppose $X_1, X_2, \cdots$ are independent random variables, each taking the values -1 and 1 with probability $q$ and $p$. A simple random walk with initial state at $S_0=a$ is thus \(S_n = a+\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\notag\)</p> <h2 id="position-of-walk-after-n-steps">Position of walk after $n$ steps</h2> <p>Any possible path is unequally defined by set of states $s_0,s_1, s_2, \cdots$. The probability that the first $n$ steps of walk follow a given path $(s_0, s_1, \cdots, s_n)$ is $p^rq^l$ where r and l are the number of right and left steps. The probability of $S_n=b$ is thus a binomial \(P(S_n=b) = \binom{n}{r}p^{r}q^{n-r}=\binom{n}{\frac{1}{2}(n+b-a)}p^{\frac{1}{2}(n+b-a)}q^{\frac{1}{2}(n-b+a)}\notag\) Where we use the relationship $r+l=n$ and $r-l=b-a$ to solve for $r$ and $l$.</p> <h2 id="the-reflection-principle">The reflection principle</h2> <p>The reflection principle is one important techniques for counting paths. Suppose we have a random walk $\left{S_i\right}$ with path that $S_0=a$ and $S_n=b$. Denote $N_n(a, b)$ <strong>the number of all possible paths</strong> from $(0, a)$ to $(n, b)$ and $N_n^0(a, b)$ <strong>the number of those paths that visit the origin</strong>, i.e. the path contain point $(k, 0)$.</p> <p>The reflection principle simply states that <strong>the number of paths that visit the origin is the same with the number of ‘reflected’ paths at the first visit of the origin.</strong> \(N_n^0(a, b)=N_n(-a, b), \quad a, b&gt;0\text{ and }N_n(a, b)=\binom{n}{1/2(n+b-a)}\notag\) Notice that for a paths that visit origin first time at point $(k, 0)$, we cna flip the path from $0$ to $k$ and create a unique path from $(0, -a)$ to $(n, b)$, therefor creating a one-one mapping between the collection of two such paths.</p> <p><strong>A plot of relfected path here</strong></p> <h2 id="no-revisit-path">No revisit path</h2> <h3 id="number-of-no-revisit-path">Number of no revisit path</h3> <p>If $b&gt;0$, then the number of paths from $(0, 0)$ to $(n, b)$ which <strong>do not revisit origin</strong> is $(b/n)N_n(0, b)$.</p> <p>If the first step move to left (-1), then the path have to revisit the origin in the future. Thus, the first step of no revisit paths has to be $(1, 1)$, then the total number of no revisit paths is \(N_{n-1}(1, b)-N^0_{n-1}(1, b)=N_{n-1}(1, b)-N_{n-1}(-1,b)=\binom{n-1}{1/2(n+b-1)}-\binom{n-1}{1/2(n+b)}\)</p> <h3 id="probability-of-no-revisit">Probability of no revisit</h3> <p>The probability of a path $S$ with $S_0=0$ and $S_n=b$ with no revisit to the origin is \(\mathbb{P}(S_1S_2\cdots S_n\neq0, S_n=b)=\frac{|b|}{n}\mathbb{P}(S_n=b)\notag\) the probability of the path $S$ that do not revisit its origin in the first $n$ step is just sum over all $b$ for the probability above \(\mathbb{P}(S_1S_2\cdots S_n\neq0)=\frac{1}{n}E(|S_n|)\notag\) The first probability is easily obtained noticing that the probability for each such path is $p^{1/2(n+b)}q^{1/2(n-b)}$ and the total number of no revisit paths is $(b/n)N_n(0, b)$.</p> <h2 id="maximum-position">Maximum position</h2> <h3 id="probability-of-maximum-position-of-a-walk">Probability of maximum position of a walk</h3> <p>Denote the maximum position during first $n$ steps as $M_n=\max{S_i:0\leq i\leq n}$, and $S_0=0, S_n=b$. Then the probability \(\mathbb{P}(M_n\geq r, S_n=b)=\left\{\begin{aligned} &amp;\mathbb{P}(S_n=b),&amp;\quad\text{if } b\geq r\\ &amp;(q/p)^{r-b}\mathbb{P}(S_n=2r-b),&amp;\quad\text{if } b&lt; r \end{aligned}\right.\) The first part is trivial since $M_n\geq b\geq r$. For the second part, notice that $M_n\geq r$ indicates that the path will include some points at position heighter than $r$. Suppose $(k, r)$ is the first point of such, then we can flip the path from $k\leq x leq n$ around $r$, which make a new path from $(0, 0)$ to $(n, 2r-b)$. This is true for any path satisfy $M_n\geq r$. Thus, the total number of maximum path is converted to the total number of path connecting $(0, 0)$ to $(n, 2r-b)$, which is $N_n(0, 2r-b)$. The number of steps that goes left and right are again $1/2(n+b)$ and $1/2(n-b)$. \(\begin{aligned} \mathbb(P)(M_n\geq r, S_n=b)&amp;=N_n(0, 2r-b)p^{1/2(n+b)}q^{1/2(n-b)}\\ &amp;=(q/p)^{r-b}N_n(0, 2r-b)p^{1/2(n+2r-b)}q^{1/2(n-2r+b)}\\ &amp;=(q/p)^{r-b}\mathbb{P}(S_n=2r-b) \end{aligned} \notag\)</p> <h3 id="probability-of-reaching-new-maximum-at-particular-time">Probability of reaching new maximum at particular time</h3> <p>Previous problem state the probability of reaching a specific maximum during a walk $S_0=0, \cdots, S_n=b$. Now, we want to ask what is the probability that the walk reaches a new maximum at a particular time. The question is equivlent with the probabiliyty that a walk, start with 0, reaches $S_n=b$ for the firt time. This is given by \(P = \frac{|b|}{n}\mathbb{P}(S_n=b)\quad \text{if } n\geq 1\notag\)</p> <p>For $b&gt;0$, notie that the problem statets is equivalent to \(\begin{aligned} P &amp;= \mathbb{P}(M_{n-1}=S_{n-1}=b-1, S_n=b)\\ &amp;=p\left(\mathbb{P}(M_{n-1}\geq b-1, S_{n-1}=b-1)-\mathbb{P}(M_{n-1}\geq b, S_{n-1}=b-1)\right)\\ &amp;=p(\mathbb{P}(S_{n-1}=b-1)-(q/p)\mathbb{P}(S_{n-1}=b+1))\\ &amp;=b/n\mathbb{P}(S_n=b) \end{aligned}\notag\) The second line comes from that fact the that event $A={M_{n-1}=b-1}\cap {S_{n-1}=b-1}\cap {S_n=b}$ can only happend when the previouse step is at $b-1$. Thus $\mathbb{P}(A)=\mathbb{P}(A|M_{n-1}=b-1, S_{n-1}=b-1)\mathbb{P}(M_{n-1}=b-1, S_{n-1}=b-1)$, and the conditional probablity is simply transition probability.</p> <h2 id="revresal-method">Revresal method</h2> <p>The reversed walk $0, R_1, \cdots, R_n$ of a random walk $0, S_1, \cdots, S_n$ is \(\{0, T_1, \cdots, T_n\} = \{0, X_n.
