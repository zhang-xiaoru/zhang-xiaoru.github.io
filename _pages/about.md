I am a Ph.D. candidate in Physics with a focus on computational and theoretical condensed matter physics. My current research centers on modeling of ferroelectric oxides. I am particularly interested in integrating traditional physics-based models with emerging machine learning and data-driven approaches to predict the behavior of large-scale atomic systems. These modeling methods have the potential to accelerate the development of next-generation, energy-efficient electro-optic devices based on ferroelectric materials.

My academic journey began with experimental research on nano-scale acoustic metamaterials. While I achieved promising result in this area, I found myself developed a deeper passion for theoretical modeling and computation methods, which ultimately led me to shift my research focus. 

In parallel with my Ph.D., I am also pursuing a Master's degree in Statistics. I began this path with the goal of building a solid foundation in statistical modeling and machine learning. I believe a deeper under standing of the underlying mathematical principles is essential for interpreting and applying machine learning for physics research.
