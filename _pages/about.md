I am currently a PhD candidate working on computational/theorical condensed matter physics at Prof. Alexander Demkov's group. My current research foucsed on ferroreclrtic oxide and their applications in energy-efficient eletro-optics decvies. 

I start my graduate studies with experimental research in nano-scale metamaterial, where I use scan prob microscopy
