        Stars form when overdense regions of molecular (hydrogen gas) clouds contract due to gravity and reach temperatures capable of sustaining hydrogen fusion. Turbulence, magnetic fields, and stellar feedback complicate the dynamics of star formation. Star formation is a highly nonlinear process with a large dynamic range.

        In the end, the concentration of gas will be dense enough to form start. In reality, most start from in gravitationally-bound systems composed of multiple starts.

        The formation process can be modeled  by composing a multiphysic process with fluid dynamics in magnetic fields+gravity+radiative transfer+chemical evolution+etc
