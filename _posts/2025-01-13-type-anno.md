In Python, a type annotation or type hint is an optional notation that allows users specifies the type of parameters and return of a function. 

Examples:

```python
def add(a: int, y: int) -> int:
  '''Specify argument and return as int'''
  return a + b

def add_list(nums: list[int]) -> int:
  '''Specify argument as list of int and retun as int'''
  sum = 0
  for num in nums:
    sum += num
   retun sum

def make_dict(keys: list[str], values: list[int]) -> dict[str, int]:
  '''Specift argument as list of int and str,
  the return as a dict whose kets should all be str and value be int'''
  dict = {}
  for key, value in zip(keys, values):
    dict[key] = value
  return dict
```

Notice that adding type annotations to a function definitions **does not require the Python interpreter to check type arguments or return a converted value**. The function will work as well with other type of input. The type annotations works more of a function documentation, which helps increasing the readablity of the code.

Sometimes an argument is expected to work for different types, this can be done using `Union` class from the `typing` module

```python
from typing import Union

def add(a: Union[float, int], b: Union[float, int]) -> Union[float, int]:
  '''Specify argument and return as int or float'''
  return a + b

```

For Python 3.10 and later, this can be achived symply by `|` operator

```python
def add(a: float | int, b: float | int) -> float | int:
  '''Specify argument and return as int or float'''
  return a + b
  
```

`typing` includes various generic types and ability to customize type, which would be useful for complicated type relationships. Check a few [examples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#module-typing) .
