# Make Hypothesis
* Null hypothesis $H_0$:
    * The null hypothesis is the statement being tested
    * "=" always appears in the null hypothesis.
* Alternative hypothesis $H_a$:
    * $H_a$ is the complement of $H_0$

The alternative hypothesis is set up based on the property one want to test. Then the null hypothesis is the complement of alternative hypothesis. 
Then the null hypothesis is being test, and one hopes to reject the null hypothesis, based on the sample data, so that the alternative hypothesis (one's inference) is proven true by the data

|                      | $H_0$ True           | $H_a$ True           |
| :------------------: | :------------------: | :-------------------:| 
| Reject $H_0$         | Type \roman{1} error | Correct              |
| Fail to reject $H_0$ | COrrect              | Type \roman{2} error |


# Test Statistics

* Significant level $\alpha$: The probability taht reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true.

# T-test
t distribution
$$t = \frac{\bar{Y}-\mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}$$
* Single side: 
* Two side

**fill in image for reject/accept region**

The idea i that if $\mu = \mu_0$ is true, then $t = \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}$ would fall close to the center with high probability. If t fall far from center (rejection area), it is less likely to be true that $\mu = \mu_0$.

For example, if $H_0:\mu \geq \mu_q$, then if the sample give $t<<0$, and we believe that $H_0$ is true. Then the probability that this ($t<<0$) happens is very small ($\alpha$). Thus, if we reject $H_0$ noe, the probability we make mistake is also small. We therefor feel confident to reject $H_0$.
